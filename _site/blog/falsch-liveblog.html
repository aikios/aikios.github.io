        <p class="title">Falsch-liveblog</p>
        <p class=" body"><i>We now join a broadcast already in progress -- this post is refined from notes taken on my phone 
            during the show (hence the liveblog, and the fake nature of this liveblog).</i></p>

        <p class="body">On this gray and dreary Friday morning, I found myself yet again grappling with the dreaded “blog”. 
            What could I possibly write about? This fear was not long for this world: for today was the day of the 
            multicultural show.  </p>
        <p class="body">Alas! Not a single one of my classes visited this show, and as eighth period started, I had all but given in. 
            But my resignation was hasty: we had a SUB! I quickly finished the physics assignment that we had been left to complete, 
            and made a sincere entreaty to the sub if I may be excused to go watch the show.</p>
        <p class="body">Mr. Farrell, in his eternal grace, smiled benevolently, and released me from that industrial classroom.
        </p>
        <p class="body">As I entered the room, the first poem recital by BSLA was beginning. The poem was very interesting, but the 
            mood was interrupted by juvenile laughter at the word “sexiness”. I did not have many other thoughts 
            regarding this performance.</p>
        <p class="body">
            Following that was the violin duet, by a club whose name I did not catch. I cannot sugarcoat it -- this duet was not every 
            good. There was a very earnest effort made, and this I will acknowledge. However, the overall effect was very discordant, 
            and the mysterious piece clashed very much with the overall vibe of the show. During the performance, there was a lot of 
            suppressed laughter, which came across as very rude to me. Even if a performance does not agree with you, I think you 
            should save your criticisms for after the show. 
             </p>
        <p class="body">
            Next up was another poem from BSLA, this time an original composition. I really enjoyed this poem, despite finding it 
            quite similar to another original poem that I had heard in an assembly at North -- my sneaking suspicion is that it was 
            the same person reciting the same poem both times. The poem itself was very compelling to listen to, with interesting rhyme 
            schemes woven in -- it reminded me a lot of the poem by Amanda Gorman that we listened to in class. The message of self 
            acceptance was also very powerful.
        </p>
        <p class="body">After that was a “performance” by the MSA. I say “performance” because the first half of it sounded a lot like an infomercial for Islam, 
            which was old information for me, but I suppose that some people must have been educated. They also had a beautiful recitation of an ayat or two from 
            the Quran, followed by the translation, conveying a powerful message about doing good things and avoiding sin. I enjoyed this segment, but I may be 
            biased since I eat lunch regularly with one of the presenters.</p>
        <p class="body">To close out the show was the K-Club K-pop dance performance, which tends to be one of the stronger segments of the show based on what I 
            have seen in my career at North. I have to say that I am not a fan of K-pop, in fact, I am something of the opposite of a fan. Nevertheless, the 
            skill of these dancers was amazing, although they could have been more in sync with each other and the music. The visual effect was still stunning.</p>
        <p class="body">Overall, I would say that it was more or less the same as every multicultural show I’ve ever seen.</p>
