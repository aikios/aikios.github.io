        <p class=" body"><i>Naperville as we (don’t) know it...</i></p>

        <p class="body">If you’re like me and love to eat sweet foods (which you probably do), you might have
            heard about the imminent opening of Cafe Cebu, which promises to be a fascinating addition to
            Naperville’s dining scene with its French- and Filipino-inspired treats. </p>
        <p class="body">Stores don’t just pop up out of nowhere, however… Those that are familiar with the
            area (Cress Creek Square Shopping Center) will recognize that suite #117, the one that Cafe Cebu is
            slated to fill, was just recently vacated. There formerly stood Algo Dulce, a Mexican-inspired
            creamery. I had been meaning to try it out for a year, until suddenly, I realized I couldn’t.
            As quickly as it had came, it was GONE!</p>
        <p class="body">To me, it seemed surprising how quickly the shop had disappeared, but on a grander scale,
            is just another casualty of a trend. What trend? A trend of replacement.</p>
        <p class="body">The Ship of Theseus, for those not familiar, is a philosophical thought experiment considering
            identity. Based on a Greek myth, it concerns the titular ship of the titular Theseus, which, after having
            completed its journey, was preserved by the Athenians. Their preservation did not just consist of
            keeping it in a museum -- rather, they took the ship’s rotting planks out and replaced them with strong,
            fresh new ones. This, of course, raised the question: Was it still the same ship?</p>

        <p class="body">In a way, Naperville is just like the Ship of Theseus. Bits and pieces are slowly being
            replaced, with new ones that are bigger, better, more fancy, or just different. Remember Classic Cinemas
            on Ogden, where the Costco is now? Or the Forever Yogurt that used to be across from Barnes and Noble?
            Or what about the old Nichols Library? Is the Naperville of 2021 the same as the Naperville of 2011, or
            even the Naperville of 2018?

        </p>
        <p class="body">It seems that Naperville is constantly rebuilding itself, but for what? It’s akin to
            a militarization, like Naperville is gearing up for battle… but for what?</p>
        <p class="body">It’s interesting to think about how thought experiments are applicable in daily life. </p>
