        <p class=" body"><i>Here’s a spoiler warning, for those who care about that sort of thing…
            </i></p>

        <p class="body">Last weekend, I decided to go out and see <i>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</i>. I had watched the
            first
            <i>Venom</i> when it was in theaters, on a whim. I wasn’t expecting to, but I found that I really enjoyed
            the
            story of Eddie Brock, a reporter who gets saddled with a symbiotic alien. Normally, Venom is portrayed as a
            foil to Spiderman, as he was in Sam Raimi’s <i>Spider-Man 3</i>. With Venom, we get to see a sort of
            anti-hero
            story
            play out as Brock, a journalist for the modern age, uses Venom to help him expose a predatory corporation
            on his YouTube-channel style news show.
        </p>
        <p class="body">I really liked the dynamic it created, the contrast between Brock’s attempts to fix his life,
            with his career and love
            life in danger from his refusal to write puff pieces, and Venom’s search for a stable host, and more
            importantly, food. </p>
        <p class="body"><i>Let There Be Carnage</i>, though, destroys anything that film was building up to. I want to
            start
            with saying there were
            simply too many jokes in this movie. I would not be surprised to find that the movie had one joke every five
            seconds. It was
            simply over the top, and ruined any sort of tension or development going on at any time. I would even go so
            far as to say that
            the movie would be redeemed with the removal of every joke, gag, and wisecrack.
        </p>
        <p class="body">The film, on the other hand, starts with the introduction of a shallow conflict between Venom
            and Brock, primarily to wedge a plot point in. Venom wants to eat brains and criminals, Brock is against
            this, leading to Venom feeling like he is not appreciated enough by Brock. All of this is happening as Brock
            interviews a criminal on death row to try and find the bodies he hid. The outward malevolence displayed by
            this criminal, Cletus Kasady, is overkill in terms of foreshadowing him as the main villain of the film,
            Carnage. Venom, fed up with Brock, leaves him, just as Kasady escapes prison and starts his rampage. Venom,
            predictably, returns to Brock before he has to confront any problems on his own, and after a an admittedly
            grand showdown at an admittedly grand cathedral, the movie ends. </p>

        <p class="body">If you couldn’t tell, I did not like the plot very much, feeling that it was too rushed in most
            places, and written with a lack of any deep conflict or meaning. The characters do not develop at all, and I
            was not left with much at the end, besides admiration for whoever designed the cathedral the showdown took
            place in (seriously, it is beautiful, almost as great as the sets in the <i>Amazing Spider-Man movies</i>).

        </p>

        <p class="body">There isn’t too much else to say, I guess... </p>
