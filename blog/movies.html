        <p class=" body">How many of you have watched a movie in the past year or so?</p>

        <p class="body">I don’t mean clicking play on Netflix, or Hulu, or some shady site on page 10 of Google.
            I mean to ask how many of you actually dressed up, bought a ticket, drove to the theater, and went to see a
            movie?</p>
        <p class="body">Obviously there’s nothing wrong with watching a movie in the former method. In both cases, you
            sit
            and watch whatever you want to watch for an hour or two, then you go back to doing whatever it was that you
            were
            doing. There might not even be a difference.
        </p>
        <p class="body">Or is there?</p>
        <p class="body">The word “movie” is an abbreviation of the term “moving picture” (which is essentially what a
            movie is).
            Today they are known as motion pictures, and are pretty commonplace. But “movies” when they first came out
            in the early
            20th century were a big deal. A night at the theater demanded the same level of decorum and dress as a night
            at the opera, often being shown in halls of similar decor and structure. Going to a showing was a chance to
            see
            and be seen in addition to seeing the movie. Shows were long, drawn out affairs with snacks and
            intermissions, and
            people would jump at the chance to go to one.</p>
        <p class="body">Today, however, we have a much different story. Box office attendance statistics show that
            moviegoers
            are a dying breed, as attendance numbers have been steadily declining for a while now. After all, why go to
            the
            movies anymore? Why dress up, drive to the theater, pay premiums on popcorn and sugary drinks just to do
            something
            you could have just as easily done in your pajamas at home?</p>
        <p class="body">If you’re expecting an answer from me, I don’t have one. The success of streaming giants like
            Netflix,
            Hulu, HBO Max, and Disney +, among others, just goes to show that people would prefer to watch movies at
            home, just like
            TV shows. Its more convenient to be able to pause the movie and take a bathroom break, or attend to some
            other sudden
            problem. Its more convenient to not have to plan in advance and take 3 hours out of your schedule to. </p>
        <p class="body">But at the same time, this convenience (in my opinion, of course) is what detracts from the
            viewing experience.
            Having your phone next to you prevents full immersion, after all, who can resist the temptation to check it
            every
            time the screen glows with a notification? And obviously you cannot experience the movie the same way you
            can with a massive
            90-foot screen and booming speakers. Not to mention the reminders sitting in your room and around you that
            you should probably
            be working on your homework and/or college essays… </p>
        <p class="body">Maybe I’m just bitter that Evangelion 3.0+1.0 released exclusively on Amazon Prime instead of
            having a theatrical run
            first. But most people cannot deny the superiority of the theater experience when it comes to watching
            movies. </p>
        <p class="body">Unfortunately, this does not translate into the necessary numbers. As mentioned earlier, movie
            theaters have
            been seeing steadily declining audiences. Theater giants like AMC are heavily bet against; until they
            aren’t, as evidenced by
            the miraculous rally earlier this year. Even though stocks rocket up, this doesn’t mean audiences are coming
            back. The pandemic
            might simply be the final nail in the coffin for movies.
        </p>
        <p class="body">If you didn’t recognize the picture above, its of the marquee from the Ogden 6, a few days
            before it was
            torn down. The theater, which was on Ogden, stood where a Costco now stands. I wonder why we need two
            Costcos in Naperville. But that, in turn, begs the question of why we need more than one movie theater.</p>
        <p class="body">I don’t mean to tell you to go out there and watch a movie at a theater right now. Movie
            theaters may just be a thing of the past,
            much like how traveling carnivals and the circus were. It’s not our place, as the consumers, to decide…</p>
        <p class="body">Or is it?</p>
