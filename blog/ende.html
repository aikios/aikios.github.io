        <p class=" body"><i>14 posts. It's been a trip. I didn't get very many comments, so if you're reading this, please comment, even if it's out of pity :(</i></p>
        <p class="body"><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/jq5j92.mp4">My voices video project essay.</a></p>
        <p class="body"><i>Q: What are the two most influential  ideas you learned from your research?  Why did these ideas impact you so much?</i>  </p>
        <p class="body">A: One of the most influential ideas I learned from my research was the idea of ‚Äúleukocentrism‚Äù, or the tendency of Hollywood to 
            whitewash or otherwise adapt movies and stories for the white palate. This is done under the idea that these films will be more relatable for a 
            greater portion of the demographic, and so these films will be more successful. I personally thought it made a lot of sense business-wise, but 
            obviously money should not be the main motivator behind movie production. I think its far more important to focus on sharing a wide variety of stories 
            and voices so that America‚Äôs cultural horizons are widened. <br>
            Another influential idea that I learned about from my research was the idea of ‚Äúdiversity checkboxes‚Äù as discussed by the actor Stephanie Hsu on a
            podcast. It talks about how actors are often cast in small enough roles that they aren‚Äôt unnoticed, but they do not affect leukocentric stories, 
            so that a film will look diverse when in reality it isn‚Äôt all that diverse. I thought that this practice harms diversity because it leads the
            population to believe that diversity is progressing, when in reality, historically excluded voices are not getting the representation that they
            deserve in major blockbusters. In this sense, I think we need to move away from the ‚Äútoken‚Äù form of diversity, and move towards a paradigm of 
            screenwriting in which these voices and identities are woven into the stories on screen from the bottom up.    
        </p>
        <p class="body"><i>Q: What do you hope people will learn from your project?</i> </p>
        <p class="body">A: I hope that from my project, people will be able to gain a greater understanding of Asian American actors‚Äô struggle in terms of their
             unemployment, as well as the fight for greater diversity on the screen. I hope they will take this information with them as they consume the films
              that are put out in the coming years, and be able to recognize and analyze trends of representation on the big screen. </p>
        <p class="body"><i>Q: What is the most important thing you learned about yourself, your community, and your world during your time at NNHS?</i> </p>
        <p class="body">
            A: I learned that the most important thing in life is balance. I think unfortunately up until senior year, I spent a lot of time focusing completely 
            on academics, but as I entered senior year, I resolved to try and go to more events, be more outgoing, and generally try to step out of my comfort 
            zone. To say the world opened up to me would be an understatement. In this sense, I would say the most important thing I ended up learning about
             myself was the importance of stepping outside my comfort zone and trying new things. 
        </p>
        <p class="body"><i>Q: What advice would you give future NNHS seniors?</i> </p>
        <p class="body">A: I would say to do as many things as possible, and not in the sense of taking a really stacked courseload. I mean that they should try to 
            go to as many dances as possible, hang out with friends, and generally try and do anything that they might regret not doing, because it‚Äôs their last 
            chance. Also, senior year is a very chill, relaxed, stress-free kind of environment to take chances and explore new things.
        </p>
        <p class="body"><i>With that, I'll ask you one more time for a comment, even though there isn't really much to comment on with this last blog (please comment though üò≠). If I don't see you between the time you read this blog and graduation, good luck, and I'll see ya when I see ya.</i> </p>
