        <p class=" body"><i> She looked over his shoulder <br>
            For vines and olive trees, <br>
         Marble well-governed cities <br>
            And ships upon untamed seas, <br>
         But there on the shining metal <br>
            His hands had put instead <br>
         An artificial wilderness <br>
            And a sky like lead. <br>
     A plain without a feature, bare and brown, <br>
        No blade of grass, no sign of neighborhood, <br>
     Nothing to eat and nowhere to sit down, <br>
        Yet, congregated on its blankness, stood <br>
        An unintelligible multitude, <br>
     A million eyes, a million boots in line, <br>
     Without expression, waiting for a sign. <br>
     Out of the air a voice without a face <br>
        Proved by statistics that some cause was just <br>
     In tones as dry and level as the place: <br>
        No one was cheered and nothing was discussed; <br>
        Column by column in a cloud of dust <br>
     They marched away enduring a belief <br>
     Whose logic brought them, somewhere else, to grief. <br>
         She looked over his shoulder <br>
            For ritual pieties, <br>
         White flower-garlanded heifers, <br>
            Libation and sacrifice, <br>
         But there on the shining metal <br>
            Where the altar should have been, <br>
         She saw by his flickering forge-light <br>
            Quite another scene. <br>
     Barbed wire enclosed an arbitrary spot <br>
        Where bored officials lounged (one cracked a joke) <br>
     And sentries sweated for the day was hot: <br>
        A crowd of ordinary decent folk <br>
        Watched from without and neither moved nor spoke <br>
        As three pale figures were led forth and bound<br>
To three posts driven upright in the ground.<br>
The mass and majesty of this world, all<br>
   That carries weight and always weighs the same<br>
Lay in the hands of others; they were small<br>
   And could not hope for help and no help came:<br>
   What their foes like to do was done, their shame<br>
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride<br>
And died as men before their bodies died.<br>
    She looked over his shoulder<br>
       For athletes at their games,<br>
    Men and women in a dance<br>
       Moving their sweet limbs<br>
    Quick, quick, to music,<br>
       But there on the shining shield<br>
    His hands had set no dancing-floor<br>
       But a weed-choked field.<br>
A ragged urchin, aimless and alone,<br>
   Loitered about that vacancy; a bird<br>
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:<br>
   That girls are raped, that two boys knife a third,<br>
   Were axioms to him, who'd never heard<br>
Of any world where promises were kept,<br>
Or one could weep because another wept.<br>
    The thin-lipped armorer,<br>
       Hephaestos, hobbled away,<br>
    Thetis of the shining breasts<br>
       Cried out in dismay<br>
    At what the god had wrought<br>
       To please her son, the strong<br>
    Iron-hearted man-slaying Achilles<br>
       Who would not live long.<br>
     </i></p>
     <p><i>The Shield of Achilles - W.H. Auden </i></p>

        <p class="body"><i>The Shield of Achilles</i> is ostensibly an ekphrastic poem, describing the titular shield as forged 
            by Hephaestos in the thick of the Trojan War for the wrathful avenger Achilles. However, on closer examination, 
            the text becomes an admonition to war hawks, juxtaposing horrific and wretched imagery with traditional war 
            glorification in an attempt to warn the naive about the real nature of fighting.  </p>
        <p class="body">In the first stanza, we are introduced to the only two important characters in this poem. Their 
            names are not revealed nor relevant until the final chapter. Those familiar with Homer’s <i>Iliad</i>, however, 
            will recognize from the title that the woman in question is Thetis, mother of Achilles, and the smith laboring 
            on the shield is Hephaestos. The first stanza is the “call”, the first expectation in a series of comparisons 
            made throughout the poem. Thetis expects to see idealistic scenes, much like those sung of in the epic poems 
            of the time: symbols of nature’s gift of life, testaments to the reason, logic and bravery of man. Instead, 
            she sees a bleak, leaden sky.</p>
        <p class="body">In the second stanza, Thetis’ hopes are dashed. Hephaestos’ dull engraving is one of monotony and
             pain. An endless plain is summoned to mind, one without a “blade of grass” or a “sign of neighborhood”. The 
             governed city of marble is replaced with a vast army, blurred and nameless in its magnitude. The use of words 
             like “congregated”, “unintelligible”, “multitude”, and “million” help to both conjure an image of desolation, 
             but also to make clear that we are, in fact, looking at an army on a battlefield. This is an important choice 
             by Auden, one that helps the reader immediately understand what the poem is talking about: war.</p>
        <p class="body">The third stanza presents a chronological follow up to the second: the voice of someone, presumably 
            a general, calls out instructions for the army, and justifications for their fight. However, unlike the heroic 
            rallying cries of yore, this one falls upon deafened, dull ears: the soldiers just march away. They are described 
            as having “endured” the ideology that the general promotes: Auden’s wording contributes to the image of soldiers 
            who don’t know what they fight for, only that they must fight in some never-ending war. The phrase “proved by 
            statistics” lends to this portrayal as well by showing that the war is not fought by inflamed passions or for 
            glory: someone somewhere else has decided that the fight must take place, and so the banner is carried. </p>
        <p class="body">In the presentation of the second and third stanza, we also see a contrast in structure. The first stanza,
             and the fourth and the sixth after, representative of the hopes of Thetis, are all made of short and flowing lines, 
             evocative of dreams and the vague ideals chased by the yet-innocent. The stanzas of Hephaestos (the rest) contain 
             lines that are longer and more choppy, presenting a slog of a read to the reader as well as eliciting the slow, tired 
             rhythm of war and reality. This structure extends to the rest of the poem.</p>
        <p class="body">The fourth stanza harkens back to the first: we imagine Thetis looking further on this shield, 
             beautiful scenes of sacrifice that bring to mind the Grecian urn lauded by Keats. The idea of a ritual piety
              brings to mind the ancient nature of war and the battlefield as a coming-of-age for young men, told to return
               carrying their shield or being carried on it. The white cow being led to the pedestal as a sacrifice to the gods 
               is a metaphor for the innocence of youth, corrupted and blindly led towards a horrible fate for the promise of a 
               vague ideal. The theme of sacrifice and purity is especially relevant given the context of the scene as taking 
               place in the Trojan War: the warriors fight for the gods, blessed by rival factions as sacrifices, running at each 
               other on some divine chessboard. Achilles comes to bear this shield as he enters the fighting because of the loss of 
               his dear Patroclus, an innocent, glory-seeking youth who was stirred up by the fervor and ran headlong into battle, 
               unaware of the gory reality that would follow. </p>
        <p class="body">However, instead of this pure and ideal sacrifice, in the fifth and sixth stanzas, we see a much more gritty 
            reality carved by Hephaestos into the shield: three figures, presumably prisoners of war, are led into a barbed wire enclosure 
            and crucified on posts, much to the indifference of the guards standing watch. They too form a sacrifice to parallel the 
            “flower-garlanded heifer”: they represent the dark, painful side of war, the soldiers who couldn’t be the prodigal heroes they 
            thought they would be hailed as. They are the soldiers that were led to the altar of foreign theater by their country, and forgotten 
            in the name of the greater good. The inclusion of the phrase “one cracked a joke” further contributes to the sense of desolation and 
            misery: these men could not even die an honorable death, like how King Priam prostrated himself at Achilles’ feet for the body of his son. 
            The symbolism of the “ordinary decent folk” is one of the forgetting population, of the nation they fought for, the one that will 
            know of their fight, but forget what it stood for. The sixth stanza is a little more abstract: it talks in vague terms of the hopelessness 
            that these men, and soldiers in general, face. Their death as men before the death of their bodies is a powerful commentary on the 
            depersonalization present in war today: there are no heroes and their legions, no Achilles and his Myrmidons: only positions and numbers. 
            Concepts like these, as well as the mention of barbed wire, which was not invented until the 19th century, indicates that Auden is blending 
            time periods in his work: the epic idealism is the type of ancient societies, while the gritty realism reflects the world of today, with 
            emotionless and detached battle.</p>
        <p class="body">The seventh stanza is perhaps one of the most interesting, because it is the one that veers sharply from reality. Thetis looks 
            over the shoulder of Hephaestos, expecting to see a scene of athletic games and dancing. In Homer’s own text, the shield is described as 
            portraying, among 8 other scenes, a scene of men and women dancing upon a dancing-floor. However, Auden chooses to instead put on the shield 
            a weed-choked field: a barren, wretched antithesis to the original idea.</p>
        <p class="body">In this desolate lot, we are led to imagine an urchin, “aimless and alone”. Auden makes use of wordplay by positing the opposite:
             the youth makes a “well-aimed” attack with a stone on a bird, only to have the bird fly out of reach. The relative experience suggested by
              this imagery indicates a long period of ruin, because of which young children have to hunt their dinners in the wilderness. The youth takes as 
              given occurrences of life the crimes of rape and murder which are described next, further contributing to the sense of a bleak future brought 
              on by war. His world is not one of promises kept or emotions shown: these ideals were presumably eroded by constant war and strife, and suitably 
              round out the stark portrait of war that Auden portrays through the vignettes on the shield. </p>
        <p class="body">In the final stanza, we see the lame Hephaestos walk away from his masterwork, carved with his godly knowledge of the reality behind war. 
            Thetis cries out because of the horror of it all; the “shining breasts” Auden writes of represents the boundless hope, optimism, and naivete that this 
            mother possesses for her bloodthirsty child. The final two lines present one last juxtaposition: Achilles is described as “iron-hearted” and “man-slaying”, 
            truly a formidable warrior. But this is not to last, because war is what war is: a place where men go to die. Achilles will “not live long”, despite 
            the love of Thetis which made him almost invulnerable (his baptism in the river Styx): the gods will engineer a hero in Paris to surmount the insurmountable, 
            guiding the arrow to the weak spot, the chink in armor that separates men from gods, <br>and so the war rages on. </p>
