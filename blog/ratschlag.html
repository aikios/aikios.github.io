        <p class="title">Ratschlag</p>

        <p class=" body">The major takeaway from my penultimate semester of high school, I would say, would be that
            my life is full of dross. I will spare you the details for the sake of brevity, but I have realized that
            I am preoccupied with too many different activities and goals, very few of which I actually enjoy doing
            for the sake of doing. I guess I only realized this when I started ding things which I actually enjoyed:
            in the contrast to the joy I found in these activities was the castle of drudgery which I had built over
            the past few years revealed. In this half-hearted dabbling I find that my commitment to each activity
            grows, squeezing blood from the proverbial stone of my daily schedule. It’s in the shadow of this
            immense and liberating realization that I have resolved to “drop the dross”, so to say, and fill winter
            break, the next semester, and hopefully the rest of my life with more gainful pursuits, in the sense of
            a gain of “joy” and “purpose”. </p>

        <p class="body">Reflecting this, I guess that the last six months changed my perspective on just how much
            things matter. My takeaway is this: things matter a lot less than I was thinking. I was clinging to these
            things as anchors in a very turbulent time, and in doing so created deep, imaginary foundations that I then
            mentally restructured my life around. Maybe it is because I have sent out the college applications that
            mattered to me, but I find myself questioning the things I have done and the clubs and activities I have
            taken part in.
        </p>
        <p class="body">In a sense, I’m “in too deep” to just quit everything right now. I’ve got many things standing
            between me and graduation, like AP tests, biliteracy tests, a bunch of tests that I’m probably forgetting
            about, the Aeneid, De Bello Gallico, a thousand plateaus, probably a bunch of college applications still,
            and staying afloat through second semester. Nonetheless, I’m going to try my hardest to carve out more time
            for the things I really enjoy, as well as trying new things, so as to really make the most of these last few
            months in high school.

        </p>
        <p class="body">I think a lot of high schoolers feel pressured to be part of everything, and to try and climb
            these massive mountains (metaphorical, in most cases) because they think that it will help them stand out in
            the applications pool. I think there are quite a few things wrong with this, having learned from experience.
            What’s understated, I think, is the importance of finding something you can truly enjoy and immerse yourself
            in. Enjoying an activity will do wonders for your engagement and growth in that field. It’s hard to make
            yourself do something, and even if you can muster the force of self-will, you will undoubtedly run into
            mental and psychological obstacles. This idea can be summed up thusly: if your heart’s not in it, nothing
            is.
        </p>
        <p class="body">My advice, then, for incoming seniors, is simple and widely available (and pithy, I would like
            to think): “follow your heart”. It is my firm belief that if you start doing things you actually want to do,
            you will find that the things you dislike will all start to fall away, and you will find yourself living the
            life you want to live. Sure, it sounds like it came off the back of a Hallmark card. I invite you to give it
            a try, though, before you give it the proverbial “knock”.
        </p>
        <p class="body">There’s an album, by a band called “Killswitch Engage”, entitled “Alive Or Just Breathing”. I
            have not listened to a single track off of this album, or any other music by the band for that matter. The
            title of this album, however, is something that I think about every single day. Am I truly “alive”, i.e., am
            I really living, or am I “just breathing”, just existing, much like a drop of water in the stream of life?
        </p>

        <p class="body"><i>
                I think we should all be asking ourselves whether we are truly "alive", or if we are "just breathing"
                our way through the day-to-day.</i>
